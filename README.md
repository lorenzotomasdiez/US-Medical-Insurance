# U.S. Medical Insurance Data Analysis

This repository is part of a portfolio project for Codecademy.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

1. **Explore Demographic Trends**: Analyze how gender, and region influence medical insurance costs.
2. **BMI Impact Assessment**: Investigate the correlation between BMI and insurance charges, and identify potential cost-saving strategies.
3. **Smoking Habits and Costs**: Examine the significant impact of smoking on insurance costs, and explore implications for health and financial planning.
4. **Predictive Modeling** (not finished): Develop a predictive model to estimate insurance costs based on key factors.

## Data Overview

The dataset, contains the following columns:

- `age`: Age of primary beneficiary.
- `sex`: Gender of the insurance contractor (male or female).
- `bmi`: Body Mass Index, an indicator of relative weight to height.
- `children`: Number of dependents covered by health insurance.
- `smoker`: Indicates whether the beneficiary is a smoker (yes or no).
- `region`: The beneficiary's residential area in the US (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest).
- `charges`: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance, in USD.

## Conclusion

- BMI Impact Assessment
The correlation coefficient of approximately 0.198 suggests a weak positive linear relationship between BMI and insurance charges in the dataset. This indicates that as BMI tends to increase, insurance charges also tend to increase, but the correlation is not strong. It's important to note that other factors may play a significant role in determining insurance charges, and this correlation alone may not provide a complete understanding of the underlying factors influencing the costs. Further analysis and consideration of additional variables may be needed for a comprehensive assessment.


- Smoking Habits and Costs
Based on the calculated correlation coefficient of approximately 0.787 between smoking and insurance charges, we can conclude that there is a strong positive correlation. This indicates that individuals who smoke tend to have higher insurance charges compared to non-smokers. It's important for insurance companies to consider smoking habits when determining insurance premiums, as it is a significant factor influencing the cost of coverage. This finding highlights the importance of promoting and incentivizing healthy lifestyle choices to potentially lower insurance costs for individuals.
